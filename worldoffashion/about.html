    <div class="column">
      <p>This is Mike Scott, founder of WoF. He began this business because he wanted to create a place for designers who cared more about building a business than creating a fashion label. And by that it means, those designers who have entrepreneurial dreams and the determination to bring them to life. </p>
      <p>“Our algorithms go through the realm of social media,” Scott explains. “We follow everyone that has some type of fashion influence on social media, and we aggregate this database that visually tracks all of their posts, and all the comments on their posts. We track how it performs over time, as well as what people are actually saying in the comments.” This allows Us to rank the popularity of specific items using natural language processing.</p>
